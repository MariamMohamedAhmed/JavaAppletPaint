you can find 4 java files--> paint.java(applet) and there is also 3 classes each in separate java file: line, rectangle, oval 
where there is specifications for each shape(points, color, dashed or not, 
and count(to always repaint at the right order when it is drawn with respect to the other shapes)  


--> to start drawing choose the shape you want to use and draw.
you can also free draw if you pressed on Draw button(it keeps flashing alittle while drawing because it keeps repainting while dragging)

--> if you want to draw with a color choose your color, check the dotted checkbox.

--> if you want the new shapes to be dashed, check the fill shape to you can draw the shaped filled (for ovals and rects only).

--> you can erase using the eraser and if you cant to erase everything you can press on clearall.

--> you can undo anything except for the free drawing.

--> you can save the drawing in the same folder and will be named newPaint
(there is previous drawings using this app you can check it if you want)


Thank you for using my paint application and I hope that you have enjoyed the experience.
